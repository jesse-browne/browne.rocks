          <h1><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i> Meet Jesse</h1>
          <p>Jesse is a native Australian, raised in Sydney’s eastern suburbs by the beach.
          He has traveled extensively through his homeland and gained a deep appreciation
          for the vast landscapes during his time spent visiting as many national parks he
          could find his way to.</p>
          <p>After working in several different industries, including journalism, hospitality,
          and heavy industry he found his way back to national parks where he worked as a
          canyon and mountain bike guide in the Blue Mountains. After a stint managing the
          Australian School of Mountaineering, he decided it was time to go to school and
          find something that would challenge him and be ever changing and intellectually
          stimulating.</p>
          <p>He graduated from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology with a degree in
          Computing Studies. He found himself pulled to San Francisco, the mecca of his
          newly adopted field, looking for the intersection of technology and the environment
          movement. He found it, and Shannon, at the Sierra Club, where he builds and maintains
          some of their vast websites.</p>
          <p>He is at his core, a rogue Australian, and is looking forward to greeting new friends
          and family with his outrageous accent.</p>

          <h1><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i> Meet Shannon</h1>
          <p>Shannon is a native to the Pacific Northwest, and through seeing and studying
          the dramatic relief and tectonic activity there she has developed a deep environmental
          and vibrant outdoor ethic.</p>
          <p>After graduating with a degree in Geography from Oregon State
          University she bounced around with many different career options.
          She worked as a Park Ranger in Crater Lake National Park. There she educated and inspired visitors to
          appreciate the story behind the formation of the clearest blue lake in the world. As exhilarating as this job was
          Shannon decided she needed a “career” job and ended up plastering billboards
          across the country, and working at an advertising agency, which was far from what she
          had in mind!</p>
          <p>Soon she found herself in San Francisco, reflecting on how she could engage
          both her business and communication savvy-ness with her love of outdoor spaces and wilderness.
          She happily found Jesse, and just such a job with the Sierra Club, focusing on marketing and
          advertising for Sierra Magazine.</p>
          <p>Her family is big and her love for them bigger! She is excited to meet and welcome new family and friends!</p>

          <h1><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> The Beginning...</h1>
          <p>There was pull from the first time that we were in the same room together,
          at a new employee orientation at the Sierra Club in January 2014. It was a few months later
          still when we found each other immersed in conversation, extrapolating about the world and
          adventures to be had. Without further ado, the adventures began and a summer of extreme rafting,
          bioluminescent kayaking, casual bike riding, enthralling camping trips, and stunning drives
          through California unfolded.</p>
          <p>San Francisco is a city of love, and although there is much to explore outside of it, we have
          had a plethora of adventures within its 7x7 mile radius. Picnics and naps on the beach frequently
          unfold, as well as romantic dinners, and hilly runs through different neighborhoods. It has become
          our mission to know San Francisco as ours, by visiting every postage stamp park and finding out
          where the best Old Fashioned is served. We are delighted by the confluence of humans and nature
          and are lucky to inhabit such a beautiful thriving city together.</p>
          <p>It has been a wonderful whirlwind start to what is sure to be the story of our lives. We are
          delighted to have so many wonderful friends near and far and look forward to broadening our circle of family
          and friends. Through the vast interactions of place and time, we are blessed to have all of
          you and to have found each other!</p>
          <p>Cheers,<br />
